# Nanotag Configuration Tool

This tool helps you reconfigure your Nanotag's reporting intervals by generating the proper downlink payloads for ChirpStack.

## How It Works

Your Nanothings Nanotags can be reconfigured remotely via LoRaWAN downlinks using the official 4-byte payload format. The device:

1. **Receives** configuration commands on fPort 25 (4-byte payload format)
2. **Acknowledges** the new settings 
3. **Applies** the new recording and reporting intervals

### Payload Format Discovery

The correct payload format was discovered from the [original Nanothings configuration tool](https://web.archive.org/web/20241208203034/https://www.nanothingsinc.com/configuration-response-downlink-encoder) preserved on the Wayback Machine:

**Format**: `[2-byte record period in seconds][2-byte report period in seconds]`
- **Length**: 4 bytes total
- **Encoding**: Big-endian 16-bit integers  
- **Units**: Always seconds

## Understanding the Configuration

### Record vs Report Period

- **Record Period**: How often the device takes temperature measurements
- **Report Period**: How often the device transmits data via LoRaWAN

For example:
- Record every 15 minutes, Report every 60 minutes = 4 readings per transmission
- Record every 1 minute, Report every 1 minute = 1 reading per transmission

### Time Units

- **Minutes**: For longer intervals (recommended for battery life)
- **Seconds**: For high-frequency monitoring (shorter battery life)

## Verified Payload Examples

These payloads were verified against the original Nanothings tool data:

| Configuration | Payload | Breakdown |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 1 minute intervals | `003C003C` | 60 seconds record + 60 seconds report |
| 5 minute intervals | `012C012C` | 300 seconds record + 300 seconds report |
| 30 minute intervals | `07080708` | 1800 seconds record + 1800 seconds report |
| 1 hour intervals | `0E100E10` | 3600 seconds record + 3600 seconds report |

## Battery Life Considerations

| Interval | Estimated Battery Life | Use Case |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| 1 minute | ~3 months | Real-time monitoring |
| 5 minutes | ~8 months | Frequent updates |
| 30 minutes | ~2+ years | Standard monitoring |
| 1 hour | ~3+ years | Long-term deployment |

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Acknowledging Configuration

1. **Check Queue**: Verify the downlink is queued in ChirpStack
2. **Wait for Uplink**: Device only listens after transmitting (Class A)
3. **Verify fPort**: Must be exactly `25`
4. **Check Payload**: Ensure hex format is correct

### Configuration Not Applied

1. **Look for Acknowledgement**: Check Events tab for `configuration_acknowledgement`
2. **Wait Full Cycle**: New intervals may take 1-2 cycles to take effect
3. **Check Values**: Verify the acknowledged values match your intent

## Next Steps

After configuring your device:

1. **Monitor Events**: Watch for the configuration acknowledgement
2. **Verify Timing**: Confirm the new reporting interval is working
3. **Adjust as Needed**: Fine-tune based on your monitoring requirements
